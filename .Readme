# 🎵 TuneHive - Complete Documentation

---

## 📌 1. Project Title

**TuneHive – A Complete Music Library Management System**

A modern music management dashboard for administrators to upload songs, manage playlists, update cover images, and organize the entire music library using AWS cloud storage.

---

## 📌 2. Problem Statement

Managing large music libraries becomes difficult without a centralized system. Songs, artists, albums, and playlists often become scattered across folders. Manual management of audio files, cover images, and metadata leads to confusion and inefficiency.

**TuneHive solves this problem by providing:**

* A central admin dashboard
* Easy song uploads (audio + image)
* Playlist creation and assignment
* Real-time searching & filtering
* Cloud-based storage with AWS S3
* A modern UI for efficient content management
